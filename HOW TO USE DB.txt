1. Install XAMMP
	- Virtual Apache server and MySQL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tCWiexc05U

2. Move this repo into (windows) C:\xampp\htdocs
		       (mac) /.../wherever mac puts htdocs

3. Import DB (the .sql file found in this repo) using phpMyAdmin

	- Rename the DB to: grid (if not already named that)
	- Set DB password to: 123456 (if not already set)

4. In your browser, enter url: http://localhost/name-of-this-repo/

The wesite should now load and you should now have access to your own copy of the DB

To check that DB is connected:
	1. open http://localhost/name-of-this-repo/ in two browser tabs
	2. click on cells in the grid to hilight them
	3. If the newly hilighted cells are appearing in both tabs, the db is working.

Note all work you do on this repo that involves the DB in anyway must be done 
inside /.../htdocs, using the localhost url to check your results.
